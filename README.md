#Capstone Project: Measure how news sentiment correlates with stock price changes on the same day or in following days (lag effect)
# 📈 Apple Stock vs. News Sentiment (2012–2022)

This project explores the relationship between **U.S. news sentiment** and **Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock price movements** over a 10-year period (2012–2022). Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we analyze whether headlines and article tone can help explain — or even predict — how Apple’s stock behaves.

## 🧠 Project Objective

- Investigate whether news sentiment correlates with AAPL stock price changes.
